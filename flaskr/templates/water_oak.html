    <h1>Water Oak</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Water Oaks (Quercus nigra) are native to the southeastern United States and have been an important part of the region's history and culture for centuries. The trees were used by Native Americans for food, medicine, and building materials, and they played a role in the Civil War as sources of shade and cover. Today, Water Oaks are a common sight in parks, neighborhoods, and other urban areas throughout the South.</p>
    <h2>Biology</h2>
    <p>Water Oaks are medium-sized trees that typically grow to a height of 50 to 80 feet. They have a wide, spreading canopy and small, glossy green leaves that turn yellow-brown in the fall. Water Oaks produce acorns that are an important food source for many animals, including deer, squirrels, and birds.</p>
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
    <p>Water Oaks are sometimes called Pin Oaks because of the small, sharp tips on the lobes of their leaves. They are also sometimes referred to as Willow Oaks because of their drooping branches. Water Oaks are often used in landscaping and as shade trees, and they can be found in many public spaces, such as parks and college campuses. One interesting fact about Water Oaks is that they have a tendency to drop small twigs and branches, which can make them a bit messy in urban areas.</p>
