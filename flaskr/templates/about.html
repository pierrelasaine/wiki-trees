                Greetings! I am a second-year Computer Science major, attending Florida A&M University. I was born in Buffalo, NY but grew up in Singapore! I plan to become a Software Engineer and positively impact the world. My favorite tree (by far) is the Japanese Cherry Blossom. The color of the leaves are very vibrant, and I associate the tree with tranquility!

                Hello! Born and raised in the picturesque Savannah, Georgia, I am currently pursuing my passion for computer science as a rising junior at Florida International University. The enchanting wide canopies of Live Oak trees hold a special place in my heart, as they serve as a constant reminder of my roots. Excitingly, I am soon to embark on a new journey as a Tech Launchpad Scholar at Salesforce, where I look forward to honing my skills and learning new web dev frameworks.
