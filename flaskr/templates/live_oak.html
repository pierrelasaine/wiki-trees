    <h1>Live Oak</h1>
    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>Live Oaks (Quercus virginiana) are native to the southern United States and have been an important part of the region's history and culture for centuries. The trees were used by Native Americans for food, medicine, and building materials, and they played a significant role in the American Civil War as sources of shade and cover. Today, Live Oaks are a common sight in parks, neighborhoods, and other urban areas throughout the South.</p>
    <h2>Biology</h2>

The bark of the Live Oak is deeply furrowed and gray-brown in color, and the leaves are leathery and dark green. Live Oaks produce acorns, which are an important food source for many animals, including deer, squirrels, and birds.</p>
    <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
